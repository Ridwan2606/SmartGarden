Raspberry PI Interfacing:

- Follow the circuit diagram (SG_RASP_PI_CIRCUIT_DIAGRAM) to reconstruct the circuit
- Note that this code version is already on the PI device under 'tempread.py' which is executed upon booting up. If the code is not on the device,
Copy the python file (SG_RASP_PI_PYTHON) on the PI device and add the file to the booting up script.

Front-End:

- The angular app built for production is already on the Microsoft Azure VM in the path "C:\Users\Admins\Desktop\SmartGardenServer\SmartGarden".
 If not, build the angular app (SG_WEBSITE_FRONTEND) for production and serve the 'dist' file produced on IIS on PORT 80 on the VM

Back-End: 

- The backend is already running on the Microsoft Azure VM in the path "C:\Users\Admins\Desktop\SmartGardenServer\API backend". 
If not, copy the express app (SG_API_BACKEND) on the VM and use a process manager PM2 (for e.g) to run it.
- The database is already hosted on the VM. If not working, recreate the database using the SQL file. 
- Look for the 'data' folder in the express app. It contains the credentials of the MYSQL user for the backend and username/password 
for the basic authentication protocol used when making HTTP requests to the endpoints.
